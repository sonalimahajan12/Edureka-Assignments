1. Write in one line on command prompt to create  a file having permission as 555 if possible

$ chmod 555 yourDirectory/
$ ls -l

# your output will be similar to the following

find /desired_location -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 0755
for files
find /desired_location -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 0644
